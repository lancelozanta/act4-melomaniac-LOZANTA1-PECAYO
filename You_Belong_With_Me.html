    <h1>You Belong With Me</h1>
    <h3>by: Taylor Swift</h3>
    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <?php
    echo <p>You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>She's going off about something that you said</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>-</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>And she'll never know your story like I do</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>-</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>But she wears short skirts</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>I wear T-shirts</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>That what you're looking for has been here the whole time</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>-</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>If you could see that I'm the one</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Who understands you</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Been here all along</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>So, why can't you see?</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>You belong with me</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>You belong with me</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>-</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Hey, isn't this easy?</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>-</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>And you've got a smile</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>That can light up this whole town</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>I haven't seen it in a while</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Since she brought you down</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>You say you're fine, I know you better than that</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>-</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>She wears high heels</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>I wear sneakers</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find</p>

    <?php
    echo <p>-</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Standing by and waiting at your backdoor</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>All this time how could you not know, baby?</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>You belong with me</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>You belong with me</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>-</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Oh, I remember you driving to my house</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>In the middle of the night</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>I'm the one who makes you laugh</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>When you know you're 'bout to cry</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>And I know your favorite songs</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>And you tell me 'bout your dreams</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Think I know where you belong</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Think I know it's with me</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>-</p>
    <?php
    echo <p>Can't you see that I'm the one</p>
    <?php
